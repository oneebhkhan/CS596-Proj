# CS596 Semester Project 

## Acknowledgment

Our team is very grateful to Tomek Osinski from CARC who was of great help in setting up the mitsuba library for us on Discovery, a process which turned out to be rather convoluted and complicated.

## Tasks Outlined
1. Save timing data to .out file
2. Run on CPU on Discovery Cluster
3. Look into profiler for python
4. Multithreading for python
5. Identify where the code is being run in a parallel way \n
	Local m/c 16 threads for mitsuba, EPYC 64 threads for mitsuba
6. Identify how to visualize information
