## Introduction

We model the growth of plant objects in simulation as a decision-making process and construct the rewards and penalties based of the incident light on plant objects. Our end goal will be to train a plant sowing agent using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. 

Rendering and calculation of incident light on one plant object takes approximately 1 second on a 6 cores i7 CPU. As the RL agent sows more plants in the environment, each individual rendering could end up taking 2 or 3 orders of magnitude longer. 

In the current set up, each training episode, that represents 1 year, comprises of 365 steps, with each step representing 1 day. Currently, the render time for 1 episode is > 15 hours. It is very computationally expensive to simulate 1-year for plants in the envivronment to effectively understand the growth of plants. 

Therefore, we aim to optimize the rendering of incident light for multiple plant objects in mitsuba environment using parallel computing techniques running on CPUs and GPUs.

<p>
In the visual table above, we have serial-time on the horizontal axis and the parallel execution on the vertical-axis. The functions being executed in parallel are work_func() instances and each such function represents a single thread exectuing in parallel. The serial functions are render() and step(). The render() function is executed for each hour of the day. Both function render() and step() are executing in serial time and can be seen on the 	    horizontal axis. Some observations regarding the multiple threads execution:

	* All the threads do not start at the same time, in the render() function, we can see a tilt as shown with reference to a blue line, as can be show in the time graph. This is because of the latency of starting a new thread. In this image, there are 50 threads that work in parallel to perform the calculations.

## Acknowledgment

Our team is very grateful to **Tomek Osinski** from CARC who was of great help in setting up the Mitsuba library for us on Discovery, a process which turned out to be rather convoluted and complicated.
