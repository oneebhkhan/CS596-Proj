## Introduction

We are working on creating an Environment for a Reinforcement Learning agent capable of optimizing plant sowing strategies using rewards and penalties obtained from incident light values on plant objects. 

In order to render a scene and calculate incident light, we are using Mitsuba 2, a research-oriented rendering system. Using Mitsuba, rendering a scene and calculating the incident light on one plant object takes approximately 1 second on a 6 core i7 CPU. Typically, training of an RL model comprises of episodes in the orders of hundred or thousands, which are in turn contain several hundred or thousand steps. In the current set up, each training episode, that represents 1 year, comprises of 365 steps, with each step representing 1 day. Each step itself comprises of 12-13 render cycles, where each render cycle represents 1 daylight hour. Even if we take 1 second per plant, in the case of 500 plants, we will end up taking 500 seconds per render cycle. In order for one training cycle comprising of 1000 episodes and 365 steps per episode, our training time would be 500 x 13 x 365 x 1000 = 2.372x10^9 seconds, thus rendering our experiment impossible. 

Therefore, our goal is to optimize the rendering of incident light for multiple plant objects in the Mitsuba environment using parallel computing techniques as discussed in CSCI 596.

<p>
In the visual table above, we have serial-time on the horizontal axis and the parallel execution on the vertical-axis. The functions being executed in parallel are work_func() instances and each such function represents a single thread exectuing in parallel. The serial functions are render() and step(). The render() function is executed for each hour of the day. Both function render() and step() are executing in serial time and can be seen on the 	    horizontal axis. Some observations regarding the multiple threads execution:

> All the threads do not start at the same time, in the render() function, we can see a tilt as shown with reference to a blue line, as can be show in the time graph. This is because of the latency of starting a new thread. In this image, there are 50 threads that work in parallel to perform the calculations.

## Acknowledgment

Our team is very grateful to **Tomek Osinski** from CARC who was of great help in setting up the Mitsuba library for us on Discovery, a process which turned out to be rather convoluted and complicated.
